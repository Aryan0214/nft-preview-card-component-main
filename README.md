## NFT-Preview Card Component 

In this project, I have made the preview card depicting the Equilibrium and its energy and time. It can be used to various websites for different uses by changing the content. 

## Concepts/Languages used 
--> HTML
--> CSS
--> CSS FLEXBOX 
--> NESTED USE OF FLEXBOX 

## What I learnt from this Project 

I learned in this project how to code effectively with less usage of time. I learnt first understand the design of the given website and then think concepts to achieve that design and then start coding. It will save much time thinking later and code will not be a mess. Further, I used css flexbox in a nested way to make this preview card component. 

Expert developers please REVIEW my code and give me the suggestions to improve my code maintain-ability. It will be highly appreciated. Thank you :)
